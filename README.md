## What do the Statistics Mean?

I know the description of the of the statistics may sound condescending, but I didn't mean it that way.\
You should see my stats (┬┬﹏┬┬) (they aren't good).

### Overshoot

When the crosshair lands on a target but looses the target, the game starts tracking how much the mouse moves.
This amount is the overshoot, it is tracked because ideally once you arrive at a target you don't overshoot and miss it.\
(Should ideally be 0)

### Shot Delay

When the crosshair arrives at a target, the game starts tracking the time it takes to shoot the target.
It is the delay between you arriving at the target and shooting it, which ideally should be 0.

### Miss Fires

When a shot is fired, but doesn't hit a target it is a miss fire.
These are counted per target and should also ideally be zero because they give your opponents a heads up that you're there.

### Time to Kill Target

This is the time it takes for a target to be shot down once the player has seen the target.
